# quaverbot
plays quaver, kinda poorly and very VERY specific to my setup

## notes:
fast scroll speed ideal  
can adjust offset in keyboardhandle.py  
flow skin only or customize my code  

this will take a bit of setup to get working on another computer, must change position of capture and fix up the offset, and probably more.

## other notes:
don't use this competitively  
I'm not responsible for you if you do use this competitively
