# Quaver Bot
This bot automatically plays quaver by monitoring each lane! It isn't extremely good yet, but can usually do up to a 30 rated song. Depends on the charting obviously.

## Some Notes:
* A fast scroll speed is ideal. I found the best success rate at around 30-32.  
* You can make some adjustments to my code to get it to work with your system better such as:
  * Adjusting offset in keyboardhandle.py  
  * Changing the region you scan pixels at in main.py
  * Changing the color it looks for in main.py

By default, the flow skin is the only skin you can use with this program without customizing the code.

## Important:
PLEASE don't use this competitively. I am not responsible for you or your account if you decide to use it and get scores removed and/or your account banned. If you want to use it, you can turn on non-competitive modifiers such as no fail and no scroll velocities.
